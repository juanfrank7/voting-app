# Voting App API

This is the backend portion of an app that saves information about candidates and allows registered users to see the 
candidates with their respective proposals, allowing them to vote for the candidate of their choosing.

This RESTful API is entirely built using Spring Boot and JPA. It connects to a MySQL database through the Hibernate 
 						ORM in order to perform all the standard CRUD operations on the objects of this application.
